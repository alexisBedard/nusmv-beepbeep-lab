<h2>A benchmark for NuSMV extensions to BeepBeep 3</h2>

<p>This lab studies a formalization of event stream processing pipelines as 
Kripke structures that can be handled by a model checker. More specifically,
the <a href="https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3">BeepBeep</a> event stream
processing library has been modified in order to export chains of processors
as input files for the <a href="">NuSMV</a> model checking tool. This makes
it possible to formally verify properties on these pipelines, and opens the
way to the use of such pipelines directly within a model checker as an
extension of its specification language.</p>

<p>The goal of this benchmark is to perform an experimental evaluation of the
proposed implementation, by measuring the execution time and memory consumption
of NuXmv on a number of BeepBeep pipelines and for a sample of generic
properties, with a special focus on the impact of parameters <i>Q</i> (the size
of the internal queues in each processor) and <i>N</i> (the size of the domain
for numerical variables).</p>

<p>The data produced by this lab is presented in part in the following research
article:</p>

<h3>Categories of experiments</h3>

<p>The experiments in the lab are divided in the following categories:</p>

<ul>
<li>Experiments measuring the impact of Q and N for generic properties
representing invariants on a pipeline</li>
<li>Experiments measuring the impact of <i>k</i> for processor pipelines
involving a sliding window processor of width <i>k</i></li>
<li>Experiments verifying either <em>sequence equivalence</em> or
<em>stepwise equivalence</em> between two processor pipelines</li>
</ul>

<p>For all these experiments, memory consumption (as reported directly by NuSMV
and running time) are measured. The NuSMV model that is generated can also be
displayed by clicking on an experiment, and following the link "View the SMV
model".</p>

<h3>Pipelines included in this benchmark</h3>

<p>The benchmark contains about a dozen of different stream processing pipelines,
which are displayed graphically in <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="/queries">this
